## Description
This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. Using the terminal, the user will input the necessary information about their project into the prompted questions in the terminal. Once complete a README.md file will be generated in the ./dist folder and can be pushed up to the repo. This app was developed during the node.js module of the UTA Bootcamp.
