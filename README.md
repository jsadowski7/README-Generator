## Description
This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. Using the terminal, the user will input the necessary information about their project into the prompted questions in the terminal. Once complete a README.md file will be generated in the ./dist folder and can be pushed up to the repo. This app was developed during the node.js module of the UTA Bootcamp.

## Installation
For the installation of this app, the user should have Node.js installed as well as npm manager. Once those are installed, use ``` npm i -y ``` to download a json package and begin using the application.

## Testing
To test the application open an integrated terminal for the index.js file and run ``` node index.js ``` in the terminal. This will begin the prompted questions for the README.md file.

## Contribution
If a user wants to contribute to this repo they can download the code using an ssh key and work locally from their own repository.
