## Description
This is a command line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a userâ€™s input. This app uses Node.js, Inquirer, and fs to prompt the user with questions that cover the necessary sections needed in a README.md file.

## Installation
For the installation of this app, the user should have Node.js installed as well as npm manager. Once those are installed, use ``` npm i -y ```  to download a json package and begin using the application.

## Testing
To test the application open an integrated terminal for the index.js file and run ``` node index.js ``` in the terminal. This will begin the prompted questions for the README.md file.

## Contribution
If a user wants to contribute to this repo they can download the code using an ssh key and work locally from their own repository.
